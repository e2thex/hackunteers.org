ABOUT

This module provides "suggested terms" for free-tagging Taxonomy fields based on terms 
already submitted.  It replaces the description field on free-tagging fields with a
clickable list of previously entered terms.  If javascript is not enabled the list will
still appear but not be clickable.  It provides the best of both worlds between a
pre-existing list of terms and the ability to add new terms on the fly as needed.

REQUIREMENTS

- Drupal 5.x

CONFIGURATION

Once the module is enabled, go to admin/content/suggestedterms to configure the module.
Terms may be ordered by popularity, alphabetically, or most recently added and the list 
may be limited to any number of terms.  The settings will apply to all free-tagging fields
on all nodes.
